2. I believe that my clients and server code are working.
3.I tested my program by obviously connecting to the server and sending messages. 
  I also connected my clients to other peoplse servers and vice versa. 
  I tested the adding a newline by sending messages that were larger than 1024
  I tested the reaching the limit by reaching it and seeing if it closed.
4. The most challening part was definatley understandign select and all its macros. 
   It took me a while to understand that i could put all the observer and partcipants 
   clients in the same fdset. Also a tough part for me was when to add clients to the 
   set using FD_SET. I was trying to do it right after i stored the sd but i would have 
   problems with messages. So instead i just decided to clear the set at the beggining of
   each loop and then adding the sd to the set by looping through the arrays i had for 
   each client. It was also reassuring to me cause i know the fdset would be most up to date.
   Another challenging part to me was getting garbage being sent with my messages. I thought 
   i figured it out by looping trhough the message and then addding a null after the newline.
   But this didnt work once the message became larger than 1024 bytes. I was also sending 
   the entire length of the buffer to the observer. So its length would become the length of the 
   longest message sent. An luckly you told us in class that this was agaisnt the protocol.
   An i thought of ways to handle this which i implemented and kind of work. Then i figured 
   i could just send the size of the bytes read instead of the entire arrays. An this worked for me.

5.A variant of this assignment that would be cool, would obviously be having only one client
 instead of two. It would be able to send messages and display messages more like a traditonal chat.
